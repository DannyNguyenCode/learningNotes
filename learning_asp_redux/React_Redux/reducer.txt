a function named after resource in redux store that it manages
any action is fired, reducer gets called
2 args are current state of resource that it manages
and action that is triggered with type and payload
should return updated state

export const todos = (state, action)=>{
    const {type, payload} = action;
    switch(type){
        case LOAD_TECHNOLOGY_SUCCESS:{
            const {text} = payload;
            const newTechnology = {
                text,
                isCompleted: false
            };
            return state.concat(newTechnology)
        }
        case LOAD_TECHNOLOGY_FAILURE:{
            return state;
        }
        default:
            return state;
    }
}
