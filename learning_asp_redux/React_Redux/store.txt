connect components to redux store

import {connect} from 'react-redux';

return a connected version of our components


insread of export default component;

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
     todos: state.todos
     //state.todos is fetching data from store and filling it into the todos prop defined in the argument component   
});
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch=>({
    onCreatePressed: text => dispatch(function(text));
    //stores the action into prop onCreatePressed which is defined in argument of component

});


export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(component)


mapStateToProps     ----------      fills component prop from redux store state
    the state arg is an object that represents entire redux state
    representing different datas of application
    job is to take state object and return another object contain pieces of that state that components need access to

mapDispatchToProps      -----------     assigns action function from actions.js to component prop
    properties of object will be passed to components as props
    instead of taking state it is taking dispatch
        triggers react action
