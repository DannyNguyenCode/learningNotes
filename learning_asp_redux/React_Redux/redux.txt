redux store json object

redux store current state of application

redux actions
    are json objects   
        - action type === string
        - payload of addtional data
        - define different events that occur in application
            - data loaded or item added to cart
        - specifically define actions
redux reducers
    - what should happen to redux store when action occurs
    - when user data loaded action occurs
        - send user property to property store
        - to user data in the actions payload
components can only make changes to a state through calling an action

    -> UI  trigger action
    -> action gets reduced to updated state
    -> components get readonly permission of new state
